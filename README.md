collection of programs to create plots

## Purpose

This repository aims to:

1. provide a unified interface to create frequently used
plots such as barcharts, histograms, and scatterplots, regardless of the underlying
tools (R, Python, etc).

2. conceal less-used options to simplify the plot settings.
